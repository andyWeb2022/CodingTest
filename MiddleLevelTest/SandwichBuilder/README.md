Question

1. React Sandwich Builder
   Problem:
   Create a "Sandwich Builder" app that lets users create the ultimate sandwich.

Features:

A list of available ingredients (e.g., bread, lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon).
A "magic randomizer" button that builds a sandwich for the user randomly.
Prevent users from adding "bacon" more than 5 times (because the bacon fairy gets upset).
Display an alert if the user tries to add peanut butter and pickles together (because, why?).
Requirements:

Use React functional components.
Use useState to manage the sandwich ingredients.
Style the sandwich display to look like a vertical stack of items.
