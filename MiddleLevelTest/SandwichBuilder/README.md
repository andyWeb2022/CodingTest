# React Sandwich Builder
Problem:

   Create a "Sandwich Builder" app that lets users create the ultimate sandwich.

Features:

1. A list of available ingredients (e.g., bread, lettuce, tomato, cheese, bacon).
2. A "magic randomizer" button that builds a sandwich for the user randomly.
3. Prevent users from adding "bacon" more than 5 times (because the bacon fairy gets upset).
4. Display an alert if the user tries to add peanut butter and pickles together (because, why?).

Requirements:

1. Use React functional components.
2. Use useState to manage the sandwich ingredients.
3. Style the sandwich display to look like a vertical stack of items.
