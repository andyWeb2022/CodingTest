Problem:
Create a "Mood-o-Meter" app where users can select their current mood (e.g., happy, sad, angry, sleepy).

Features:

Based on the mood:
Display an animated emoji (e.g., ðŸ˜ƒ, ðŸ˜¢, ðŸ˜¡, ðŸ˜´).
If the user selects "angry" twice in a row, display a message: "Whoa, calm down! Want some coffee?"
Requirements:

Use React hooks for managing state.
Use CSS animations to make the emojis dance or bounce.
Store the last selected mood to detect "angry" streaks.
