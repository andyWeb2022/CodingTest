Problem:
Create a simple app that fetches random cat images from an API (e.g., https://cataas.com/cat) and displays them in a grid.

Features:

Users can keep scrolling down to load more cats.
Add a "Summon the Cat Overlord" button that triggers a modal with an enormous picture of a grumpy cat (use a static image URL).
Requirements:

Use useEffect for API calls.
Use a library like react-infinite-scroll-component or custom infinite scroll logic.
Modal should include a "Close" button that works.
