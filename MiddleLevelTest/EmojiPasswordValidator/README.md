# Emoji Password Validator

Problem:

    Build a password validator that checks if a password meets the following rules:
    1. Must be at least 8 characters long.
    2. Must include at least one emoji (e.g., ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ”¥, ðŸ’¥).
    3. Show a funny message for each validation failure, e.g., "Your password is too short, like my patience." or "Add an emoji to bring some life to your password."

Requirements:

    1. Use useState to handle the input.
    2. Display real-time validation messages below the input field.
    3. Make it mobile-friendly.
