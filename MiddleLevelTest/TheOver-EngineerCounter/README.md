The Over-Engineer Counter
Problem:
Create a counter app with these over-the-top features:

Features:

A button to increase the count.
A button to decrease the count.
A "pro mode" button that switches to voice recognition so the user can say "up" or "down" to change the count (you can fake this with a simple alert saying, "Pro mode is unavailable for free users.").
A hidden Konami code (↑↑↓↓←→←→BA) that sets the count to 1337 and displays "You win at life."
Requirements:

Use React state for the count.
Add some playful styling.
